# --- Core Frameworks & Libraries ---

torch                   # For building classical neural networks (Encoder, Decoder, etc.).
torchvision             # Provides the MNIST dataset and image tools.
qiskit                  # The main SDK for creating and working with quantum circuits.
qiskit_machine_learning # Provides tools for quantum machine learning models (QNN, QSVM).
qiskit_algorithms       # Contains high-level quantum algorithms like VQE/QAOA.
qiskit-aer              # The fast, local simulator for running quantum circuits.
qiskit-optimization     # A specialized library for solving optimization problems (QUBO).

# --- Scientific Computing & Utilities ---

numpy                   # The fundamental library for all numerical and array operations.
matplotlib              # The primary library used for creating all plots and visualizations.
scikit-learn            # Used for its classical SVM, PCA, and performance metrics.
tqdm                    # Creates the smart progress bars for training loops.

# --- MLOps & Configuration ---

mlflow                  # The platform for logging and tracking all experiment runs.
PyYAML                  # Used to read and parse the main `config.yaml` file.
